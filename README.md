com.github.quickhull3d - A Robust 3D Convex Hull Algorithm in Java
===========

This is a 3D implementation of QuickHull for Java, based on the original paper by Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa and the C implementation known as qhull. The algorithm has O(n log(n)) complexity, works with double precision numbers, is fairly robust with respect to degenerate situations, and allows the merging of co-planar faces.

A tutorial on the QuickHull algorithm by Dirk Gregorius (Valve Software) was given at the 2014 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

There are some other 3D convex hull implementations available in netland, but I didn't find any that satisfied all the above criteria, so I created my own. The principal class is QuickHull3D, which is contained within the package com.github.quickhull3d. It is actually a reimplementaion of an earlier piece of work, ConvexHull3D, which was based on an insertion algorithm and had a complexity of O(n^2).

Mark Newbold has used this package to create a very picturesque applet that creates and displays Waterman polyhedra

## Convex modification
This fork adds a methods "convex" on the QuickHull3D class, which can be applied to a triangulated convex
hull to include some of the points on the inside of the hull. It's based on the 
"A New Concave Hull Algorithm and Concaveness Measure for n-dimensional Datasets" 2010 paper by Jin-Seo Park and Se-John Oh,
but modified to take a deflection angle rather than an abstract threshold value
